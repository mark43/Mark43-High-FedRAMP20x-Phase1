# Audit Directory

This directory houses generated audit reports, providing an offline-friendly HTML view of the changes made to Mark43's Key Security Indicator (KSI) statuses and other relevant details.

The reports are generated from data files (e.g., `mock-annual-audit-2029_datafile.csv`) and presented in a user-friendly HTML format (e.g., `mock-annual-audit-2029.html`). This allows for easy review and analysis of audit results without requiring a live connection to any system.
