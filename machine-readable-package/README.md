# Machine-Readable Package Directory

This directory will contain all the machine-readable code for Key Security Indicator (KSI) verification and, potentially, the analysis as well.

This directory will also be used to store documents that have been converted to the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) format, providing a standardized, machine-readable representation of our security controls and assessment results.
