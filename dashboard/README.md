# Dashboard Directory

This directory contains an offline HTML dashboard file used to view all Key Security Indicator (KSI) families, their corresponding sub-controls, and Mark43's current compliance status for each.

The dashboard also provides information on how each control is verified and how Mark43 satisfies the requirements for each control. This provides a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of the system's security posture.
