# Evidence Directory

This directory contains folders for specific audits, each marked with a unique ID (e.g., `auditID_########`). Within each of these folders, you will find all the Python scripts that were used during that specific audit to verify security compliance.

This unique ID is critical because the scripts are version-controlled in GitHub. By associating an audit "run" with a specific set of versioned scripts, we can ensure that we can always trace back the exact methods used for verification for any given audit.

To maintain this link, the specific version of each Python script may be maintained within the file itself or appended to the filename.
