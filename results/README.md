# Results Directory

This directory contains an aggregation of JSON files that track the compliance status of the Key Security Indicator (KSI) controls.

The files are organized by year and then by month, allowing for a clear, chronological record of the compliance status over time.

The `/current` directory will be leveraged for near real-time current KSI alignment statuses, when this repository is directly consumed by APIs, etc.
